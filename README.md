I have created a backend for a food delivery app.

The user registration, login and user persistance is handled by Firebase and synced to MongoDB.

The idea of the app is - I should be able to add the restaurants as an admin, then based on the location of the user, within 10km radius, it should populate the restaurants, 
then rest of the functionalities like cart, address, user orders and feedbacks are added.

For now only logic I have not added is payment gateway.

As I get more ideas, I will implement it here.

Will be adding the Swagger UI for more clarity.

If anyone likes my project, you can also contribute to enhance it and lets make it a bang.

Just copy the project and do npm install
